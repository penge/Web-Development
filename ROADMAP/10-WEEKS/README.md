# 8 WEEKS

Over the next 8 weeks we will teach you how to become an **independent** Ruby on Rails Web Developer.

<br/>

#### Meaning of independent:

> Becoming independent means you understand the basic and intermediate topics of Ruby and
> Ruby on Rails, you know the essential parts of HTML, CSS and Javascript, and you also
> understand how to track changes of the code, how to test, debug, deploy.
>
> Last but not least, you know where to search for more information later, so you can
> expand your knowledge and become even better.

<br/><br/>

## Topics
- HTML (defines structure)
- CSS (defines styling)
- Javascript (defines behaviour)
- Ruby (programming language)
- Ruby on Rails (web framework based on Ruby)
- Git (tracks changes of the code)

<br/>

## Weeks
`1`&nbsp;&nbsp; Course will begin by teaching you the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

`2`&nbsp;&nbsp; It will continue by teaching you the Ruby language.

`3`&nbsp;&nbsp; After feeling confident in Ruby, you will learn essential parts of debugging, testing, and documenting.

`4`&nbsp;&nbsp; Next we will look up at Git, how to track changes of the code, and how to work in a team.

`5`&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving to Ruby on Rails. Creating first app.

`6`&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Ruby on Rails journey continues. Working with multiple models.

`7`&nbsp;&nbsp; Building APIs, defining resources, using AJAX. Questions. Security. Deployment. 

`8`&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking more into testing.

<br/>

## Every day
- new topic you will learn,
- challenges you will be given to solve,
- teacher's support.

<br/>

## After the course
- you understand the basics,
- you have accomplished many challenges,
- you have finished several smaller projects,
- you are ready to become an independent developer.

# WEEK 1

To define structure, styling, and behaviour of any website that is being presented to the user, we

# WEEK 2

You will learn the basics of the Ruby language, a beautiful programming
language that is focusing on simplicity, productivity, and developers' hapiness.
It is also an underlying layer you need to understand before jumping into Ruby on Rails.

<br/>

# WEEK 3

In the week you will not only practice more Ruby, you will also learn how to use debugging,
a powerful technique that helps you to find and repair bugs. Then, you will learn how to
write tests to verify your code works as expected. And last, you will learn how to document
the code, and how to generate the documentation.

<br/>

## Days

`1`&nbsp;&nbsp; [Ruby][ruby] (debugging {pry, byebug}, binding)
